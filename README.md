# k8s-nextcloud-subdir
This repository contains the config maps required to setup nextcloud in k8s. Following the instructions here (https://faun.pub/nextcloud-scale-out-using-kubernetes-93c9cac9e493) the config map will make nextcloud work in the sub-directory <i>/nextcloud</i>. The how to videos are available on youtube at youtube.com/@ILoveOpenSourceSoftware. The video in which the file has to be applied is [11.02]. However, keep in mind that applying the files from this repo will require slight changes to the instructions provided in the afore mentioned video. Instead of extracting the nextcloud file into the sub-dir /nextcloud and then moving the contents to the root folder, just keep the file where they are and deploy the config maps from this repo.
